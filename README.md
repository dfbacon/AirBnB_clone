What is it?

This is the Holberton School AirBnB clone project, i.e. HBnB.

emphasis on the fundamental concepts of Holberton's higher level programming
track.

The project should contain:
  o A website to display the final product
  o An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data
  o A database or files that store data
  o A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface
