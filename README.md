What is it?
-----------

This is the Holberton School AirBnB clone project, i.e. HBnB.

The project goal  is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website, with
emphasis on the fundamental concepts of Holberton's higher level programming
track.

The project should contain:

  o A website to display the final product

  o An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data

  o A database or files that store data

  o A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface
